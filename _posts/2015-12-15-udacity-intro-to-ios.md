So I've started the [intro to iOS programming class on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585) and I've seriously learned a lot. If I'm completely honest, I would've _never_ figured out "contstraints" on my own. And I'm so used to using the Eclipse IDE that Xcode, with all it's bells and whistles, kind of blows my mind. 

Swift is definitely new to me. I took the [Learn Swift Programming Syntax class before the intro to iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-swift-programming-syntax--ud902) course before this one and I was surprised at how odd Swift seemed (my experience is in Java/C/JavaScript a little Python). Optionals? What? 

![Also, I created a color scheme that I'm pretty proud of](/assets/Intro2iOS.png)
_I'm pretty pleased with this color scheme I made as well_

But I'm getting better. One of the things the class has helped me with is terminology. I had no idea what creating an "Outlet" would refer to. I'm much more used to web development/clientside javascript, where I reference a UI element explicitly by name instead of creating an "Outlet" to connect an element to code. But I get it now. And I'm seeing the parallels of app dev to client side webdev. I really like client side webdev, so I'm excited to continue learning about iOS dev. I hope to be able to realize my app idea before too long!
