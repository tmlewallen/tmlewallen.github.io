<p>Well, I did it. I have a cool name for my blog and a place to host it so I'm done, right?</p>

<p>I'd like to thank the Internet, the Foo Fighters for coming out with a free EP today, and my friends for leaving beer in my fridge for me to drink to celebrate.</p>

<p>In conclusion, don't forget to include this meta tag in your Bootstrap webpage. It's important. 
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</pre>
</p>
